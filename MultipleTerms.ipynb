    "The mixed models considered in the previous chapter had only one random-effects term, which was a simple, scalar random-effects term, and a single fixed-effects coefficient. Although such models can be useful, it is with the facility to use multiple random-effects terms and to use random-effects terms beyond a simple, scalar term that we can begin to realize the flexibility and versatility of mixed models.\n",

For ease of description we will refer to the random effects as being crossed or nested although, strictly speaking, the distinction between nested and non-nested refers to the grouping factors, not the random effects."

    "One of the areas in which the methods in the package for are particularly effective is in fitting models to cross-classified data where several factors have random effects associated with them. For example, in many experiments in psychology the reaction of each of a group of subjects to each of a group of stimuli or items is measured. If the subjects are considered to be a sample from a population of subjects and the items are a sample from a population of items, then it would make sense to associate random effects with both these factors.\n",

    "> assess the variability between samples of penicillin by the *B. subtilis* method. In this test method a bulk-innoculated nutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of approximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate. When the medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots (about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface at equally spaced intervals. A few drops of the penicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the respective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an incubator for a given time. Penicillin diffuses from the pots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular zone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can be readily measured. The diameter of the zone is related in a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the solution.\n",

That’s why statisticians allow for missing data.

Some presentations of mixed-effects models, especially those related to *multilevel modeling*  or *hierarchical linear models* , leave the impression that one can only define random effects with respect to factors that are nested. This is the origin of the terms “multilevel”, referring to multiple, nested levels of variability, and “hierarchical”, also invoking the concept of a hierarchy of levels. To be fair, both those references do describe the use of models with random effects associated with non-nested factors, but such models tend to be treated as a special case.\n",

    "The blurring of mixed-effects models with the concept of multiple, hierarchical levels of variation results in an unwarranted emphasis on “levels” when defining a model and leads to considerable confusion. It is perfectly legitimate to define models having random effects associated with non-nested factors. The reasons for the emphasis on defining random effects with respect to nested factors only are that such cases do occur frequently in practice and that some of the computational methods for estimating the parameters in the models can only be easily applied to nested factors.\n",

When random effects are associated with multiple factors exactly the same computational methods are used whether the factors form a nested sequence or are partially crossed or are completely crossed. There is, however, one aspect of nested grouping factors that we should emphasize, which is the possibility of a factor that is *implicitly nested* within another factor. Suppose, for example, that the factor was defined as having three levels instead of 30 with the implicit assumption that is nested within . It may seem silly to try to distinguish 30 different batches with only three levels of a factor but, unfortunately, data are frequently organized and presented like this, especially in text books.

    "\n",
    "One of the many famous statements attributed to Albert Einstein is “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” In statistical modeling this *principal of parsimony* is embodied in hypothesis tests comparing two models, one of which contains the other as a special case. Typically, one or more of the parameters in the more general model, which we call the *alternative hypothesis*, is constrained in some way, resulting in the restricted model, which we call the *null hypothesis*. Although we phrase the hypothesis test in terms of the parameter restriction, it is important to realize that we are comparing the quality of fits obtained with two nested models. That is, we are not assessing parameter values per se; we are comparing the model fit obtainable with some constraints on parameter values to that without the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the more general model, $H_a$, must provide a fit that is at least as good as the restricted model, $H_0$, our purpose is to determine whether the change in the quality of the fit is sufficient to justify the greater complexity of model $H_a$. This comparison is often reduced to a *p-value*, which is the probability of seeing a difference in the model fits as large as we did, or even larger, when, in fact, $H_0$ is adequate. Like all probabilities, a p-value must be between 0 and 1. When the p-value for a test is small (close to zero) we prefer the more complex model, saying that we “reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$”. On the other hand, when the p-value is not small we “fail to reject $H_0$”, arguing that there is a non-negligible probability that the observed difference in the model fits could reasonably be the result of random chance, not the inherent superiority of the model $H_a$. Under these circumstances we prefer the simpler model, $H_0$, according to the principal of parsimony.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the general principles of statistical hypothesis tests. To perform a test in practice we must specify the criterion for comparing the model fits, the method for calculating the p-value from an observed value of the criterion, and the standard by which we will determine if the p-value is “small” or not. The criterion is called the *test statistic*, the p-value is calculated from a *reference distribution* for the test statistic, and the standard for small p-values is called the *level* of the test.\n",

    "In Sect. [sec:variability] we referred to likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for which the test statistic is the difference in the deviance. That is, the LRT statistic is $d_0-d_a$ where $d_a$ is the deviance in the more general ($H_a$) model fit and $d_0$ is the deviance in the constrained ($H_0$) model. An approximate reference distribution for an LRT statistic is the $\\chi^2_\\nu$ distribution where $\\nu$, the degrees of freedom, is determined by the number of constraints imposed on the parameters of $H_a$ to produce $H_0$.\n",

In the worst-case scenario the $\\chi^2$-based p-value will be twice as large as it should be but, even if that were true, an effective p-value of 26% would not cause us to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$.\n",

    "A simple, scalar random effects term in an model formula is of the form , where is an expression whose value is the *grouping factor* of the set of random effects generated by this term. Typically, is simply the name of a factor, such as in the terms or in the examples in this chapter. However, the grouping factor can be the value of an expression, such as in the last example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because simple, scalar random-effects terms can differ only in the description of the grouping factor we refer to configurations such as crossed or nested as applying to the terms or to the random effects, although it is more accurate to refer to the configuration as applying to the grouping factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model formula can include several such random effects terms. Because configurations such as nested or crossed or partially crossed grouping factors are a property of the data, the specification in the model formula does not depend on the configuration. We simply include multiple random effects terms in the formula specifying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One apparent exception to this rule occurs with implicitly nested factors, in which the levels of one factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the other factor. In the data, levels of the factor are only meaningful within a particular level of the factor. A model formula of\n",
    "```\n",
    "strength ~ 1 + (1 | cask) + (1 | batch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "would result in a fitted model that did not appropriately reflect the sources of variability in the data. Following the simple rule that the factor should be defined so that distinct experimental or observational units correspond to distinct levels of the factor will avoid such ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, a model with multiple, nested random-effects terms can be specified as\n",
    "```\n",
    "strength ~ 1 + (1 | batch/cask)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which internally is re-expressed as\n",
    "```\n",
    "strength ~ 1 + (1 | batch) + (1 | batch:cask)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will avoid terms of the form , preferring instead an explicit specification with simple, scalar terms based on unambiguous grouping factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data, described in Sec. [sec:InstEval], illustrate some of the characteristics of the real data to which mixed-effects models are now fit. There is a large number of observations associated with several grouping factors; two of which, student and instructor, have a large number of levels and are partially crossed. Such data are common in sociological and educational studies but until now it has been very difficult to fit models that appropriately reflect such a structure. Much of the literature on mixed-effects models leaves the impression that multiple random effects terms can only be associated with nested grouping factors. The resulting emphasis on hierarchical or multilevel configurations is an artifact of the computational methods used to fit the models, not the models themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the models fit to small data sets have properties similar to those for the models in the previous chapter. That is, profile-based confidence intervals on the fixed-effects parameter, $\\beta_0$, are symmetric about the estimate but overdispersed relative to those that would be calculated from a normal distribution and the logarithm of the residual standard deviation, $\\log(\\sigma)$, has a good normal approximation. Profile-based confidence intervals for the standard deviations of random effects ($\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, etc.) are symmetric on a logarithmic scale except for those that could be zero.\n",

    "Another observation from the last example is that, for data sets with a very large numbers of observations, a term in a model may be “statistically significant” even when its practical significance is questionable.\n",
